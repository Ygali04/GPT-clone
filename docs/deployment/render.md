# Render Deployment

## Note:

Some features will not work:
- Bing/Sydney: success may vary
- Meilisearch: additional configuration is needed, [see guide here](./meilisearch_in_render.md).

Also:
- You need to create an online MongoDB Atlas Database to be able to properly deploy

## Create an account

**1.** visit [https://render.com/](https://render.com/) and click on 'Get Started for Free` to create an account and Login

**2.** Go into your dashboard

**3.** Select `New` then `Web Service`

**6.** At that point it will try to automatically deploy, you should cancel the deployment as it is not properly configured yet.

## Add Environement Variables

**1.** Next you want to go in the `Environement` section of the menu to manually add the `Environement Variables`
  - You need to use the `Add Environement Variables` and add them one by one as adding a secret file will not work in our case.

**2.** You will need to copy and paste all of these:

| ALLOW_REGISTRATION | true |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | user_provided |
| BINGAI_TOKEN |  | 
| CHATGPT_TOKEN | user_provided |

**3.** Also add `DOMAIN_CLIENT` `DOMAIN_SERVER` and use the custom render address you were attributed in the value fields

## Create and Configure your Database

The last thing you need is to create a MongoDB Atlas Database and get your connection string.
You can also restrict access to your Mongodb to only the [static outgoing IP addresses](https://docs.render.com/static-outbound-ip-addresses) for your Render hosted web service.

Follow the instructions in this document but add each of the outgoing IP addresses to the list instead of all hosts: [Online MongoDB Database](../install/configuration/mongodb.md)

## Complete the Environment Variables configuration 

**1.** Go back to render.com and enter one last key / value in your `Environment Variables`

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| MONGO_URI | `mongodb+srv://USERNAME:PASSWORD@render-librechat.fgycwpi.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority` |

**2.** **Important**: Remember to replace `<password>` with the database password you created earlier (when you did **step 6** of the database creation **(do not leave the `<` `>` each side of the password)**

**3.** Save Changes

**4.** You should now have all these variables
