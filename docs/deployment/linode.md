- Click on the 'Create' button to provision the Linode server (wait about 5 minutes after the server is on, because the server is not actually powered on yet)

## Install Docker:

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install docker.io && apt install docker-compose

        - '443:443'
      volumes:
        - ./data:/data

  ```
