Conversations Import allows user to import conversations exported from other GPT chat applications. Currently, we support importing conversations from ChatGPT, [ChatbotUI v1](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui/tree/b865b0555f53957e96727bc0bbb369c9eaecd83b?tab=readme-ov-file#legacy-code), and LibreChat itself.

Import functionality is available in the "Settings" -> "Data Controls" section.
