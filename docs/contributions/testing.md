# Locally test the app during development

## Local Unit Tests

Before submitting your updates, itâ€™s crucial to verify they pass all unit tests. Follow these steps to run tests locally:

- copy your `.env.example` file in the `/api` folder and rename it to `.env`
```bash
cp .env.example ./api/.env
```
- add `NODE_ENV=CI` to your `/api/.env` file
- `npm run test:client`
- `npm run test:api`

!!! failure "Warning"
    When executed locally, this API unit test is expected to fail. This should be the only error encountered.

<!-- ## WIP

## Run the tests

#### 1. Install the global dependencies

   ```shell
   npm ci
   npx playwright install --with-deps
   ```

#### 2. Run tests

   ```shell
   npx playwright test
   ```
   
If everything goes well, you should see a `passed` message.
